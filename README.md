# Tree-Fizz-Buzz


## Summary
Write a function that creates a new string based tree, with the same structure of the passed int tree, and make the strings into "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz" or "oldTree.Node.Data" depending on the int values of oldTree, if it's divisible by 3, divisible by 5, divisible by 3 & 5, or none of the previous is true.
